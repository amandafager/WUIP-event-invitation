# WUIP-event-invitation

This is a collaborative project between me and a student from the school's IP Form & Graphics class. Our mission was to create a fictional event invitation that communicates with targeted visitors through multiple channels. We decided ourselves which company/organization to choose from and what kind of event to create. It needed to be a personalized printed invitation with a QR code that lead to a unique landing page.

We decided to to create an invitation for the reopening of Spike Brewery's Taproom, a place where visitors can eat, drink beer och listen to good music.

# Code Review

- `images` to increase the site's speed index, you could try to make the images smaller since they take some time to load now. Lighthouse also suggested changing the filetype from PNG to JPEG.
- `url-params.js` you could write a function that capitalizes the first letter in the name on the personialized version to make it look even better!
- I appreciate the many separate files for the CSS, makes the code easier to navigate.
- It's really hard to find anything to comment on, fantastic job!! Really cool website with a fun design, and I love the animations.
