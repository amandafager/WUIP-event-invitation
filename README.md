## Code Review

- `images` to increase the site's speed index, you could try to make the images smaller since they take some time to load now. Lighthouse also suggested changing the filetype from PNG to JPEG.
- `url-params.js` you could write a function that capitalizes the first letter in the name on the personialized version to make it look even better!
- I appreciate the many separate files for the CSS, makes the code easier to navigate.
- It's really hard to find anything to comment on, fantastic job!! Really cool website with a fun design, and I love the animations.
